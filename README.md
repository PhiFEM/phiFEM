# $\varphi$-FEM with FEniCSx

$\varphi$-FEM is an immersed boundary finite element method leveraging levelset functions to avoid the use of any non-standard finite element spaces or non-standard quadrature rules.
More information about $\varphi$-FEM can be found in the various publications (see e.g. [^1] and [^2]).

This repository aims at providing an implementation of the $\varphi$-FEM in the [FEniCSx](https://fenicsproject.org/) computation platform as well as several demos to illustrate its capabilities.

## Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)/[podman](https://podman.io/)

The docker image is based on the stable dolfinx image (see [FEniCSx](https://fenicsproject.org/)).

## Usage

### Build the image (from the root directory):
Replace `YOUR_ENGINE_HERE` by `docker`, `podman` or your favorite container engine (the following instructions use Docker/podman UI).
```bash
export CONTAINER_ENGINE="YOUR_ENGINE_HERE"
cd docker/
bash build_image.sh
```

### Launch the image (from the root directory):
```bash
bash run_image.sh
```

### Run an example (inside the container from the root directory):
```bash
cd demo/weak-dirichlet/flower
```
Run the `main.py` script:
```bash
python main.py bg
```
